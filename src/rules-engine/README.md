# rules-engine

Pure D&D 5e SRD game logic — no UI, no database dependency. Fully unit-testable in
isolation. Module boundary formalized in Prompt 2.

As of Prompt 9: the static SRD content dataset (races, classes, skills, spells, starting
equipment), ability modifiers, saving throw and skill check bonuses, passive scores, the
spell slot table (full/half/pact casters), attack bonus calculation, grid movement cost
(difficult terrain, climbing, flat 5 ft diagonal), and range/targeting queries.

As of Prompt 31: `movement.ts` gains `FEET_PER_ELEVATION_STEP` — the first place a stored
elevation step count (`map_cells.elevation`, `map_tokens.elevation`) is converted to feet,
fixed at 5 to match `FEET_PER_CELL`'s flat per-cell unit. `straightCellPath` walks the
diagonal-first grid path between two points (its length equals `gridCellDistance`), and
`pathMovementCost` sums `cellMovementCost` across that path, charging a climb once per
cell-to-cell elevation delta rather than per cell walked along a plateau. Both are pure and
DB-free like the rest of this module — callers (the `app` layer) supply the actual per-cell
terrain/elevation data, since this module can't fetch it itself.

As of Prompt 47: the status condition catalog (`srd/conditions.ts`) — `CONDITIONS`, the 14
on/off SRD conditions (blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, grappled, incapacitated,
invisible, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, stunned, unconscious), each
with a stable `key`, display `name`, unique two-letter `abbreviation` (token badge labels),
SRD `description`, and a `ConditionEffects` flag set; `CONDITION_BY_KEY` for lookups.
Exhaustion is deliberately NOT in `CONDITIONS` — it's a stacking level 1-6 with cumulative
effects, exposed as `EXHAUSTION_KEY` (the stored condition_key), `MAX_EXHAUSTION_LEVEL`,
`EXHAUSTION_LEVEL_DESCRIPTIONS` (what each level newly adds, through death at 6), and
`exhaustionEffects(level)` returning the cumulative flags at a level (each level's flags
are a superset of the level below's).

The `ConditionEffects` flags are structured data for the later enforcement prompts, NOT
enforced anywhere yet: Prompt 53 (action economy) reads `incapacitated`/`speedZero`/
`speedHalved`, Prompt 56 (vision) reads `blocksVision`/`blocksHearing`/`hiddenFromSight`,
Prompt 59 (advantage/disadvantage) reads `attacksAgainstHaveAdvantage`/
`attacksAgainstHaveDisadvantage`/`ownAttacksHaveAdvantage`/`ownAttacksHaveDisadvantage`/
`abilityChecksHaveDisadvantage`/`savingThrowsHaveDisadvantage`/`autoFailStrDexSaves`. A
flag records that the condition imposes the effect at all; situational qualifiers in the
SRD text (frightened's line-of-sight clause, prone's within-5-feet vs ranged
attacks-against split, restrained's DEX-only save disadvantage) stay in the description
and are the enforcing prompt's job to resolve — so a new condition is a new catalog entry,
never a new storage shape. Level 4's halved HP maximum and level 6's death aren't
representable as boolean flags; consumers that care read the exhaustion level itself.
Applied-condition STATE lives in the database (`combatant_conditions`, see
`data-access/conditions.ts`) keyed by these catalog keys — the catalog is the single
source of truth for what keys are valid.

Still future work: the perception/vision engine (Prompt 56) and advantage/disadvantage
(Prompt 59).
